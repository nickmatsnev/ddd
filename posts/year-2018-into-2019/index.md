2018 is at its end, and now I want to list all the important things that have happened during the past year. I wrote a [similar post](//kottsov.com/posts/year-2017-into-2018/) in 2017, and I want to continue this tradition.

## Music

This year I enjoyed such artists as Luna, Illumate, Markul, STED.D, Lumen, Pyrokinesis, The Neighbourhood.

## Videos

Speaking about serials, I have entirely watched Mr. Robot this year. I haven’t watched many films and serials this year as I spent the vast majority of free time on YouTube learning web development. I have discovered the following channels that are worth mentioning here:

- [The Coding Train](//www.youtube.com/user/shiffman)
- [Marques Brownlee](//www.youtube.com/channel/UCBJycsmduvYEL83R_U4JriQ)
- [Matt D’Avella](//www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ24N4O0bP7LGLBDvye7oCA)
- [Jusuf](//www.youtube.com/channel/UCvrrZ9eseneke2UVe01ob2g)
- [Devon Crawford](//www.youtube.com/channel/UCDrekHmOnkptxq3gUU0IyfA)
- [Ali Abdaal](//www.youtube.com/channel/UCoOae5nYA7VqaXzerajD0lg)
- [DevTips](//www.youtube.com/channel/UCyIe-61Y8C4_o-zZCtO4ETQ)
- [Siraj Raval](//www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A)

## Websites

I have also discovered the following websites about programming in general and web development in particular:

- [Tania Rascia](//www.taniarascia.com/)
- [Smashing Magazine](//www.smashingmagazine.com/)
- [CSS-Tricks](//css-tricks.com/)
- [A List Apart](//alistapart.com/)
- [bitsofcode](//bitsofco.de/)
- [CSS Weekly](//css-weekly.com/)

## LinguaRead

This summer I have presented my school project called [LinguaRead](//kottsov.com/projects/linguaread/). I’ve learned a lot about Android and Java in order to create this application. I experienced a lot of problems regarding reading electronic books on my smartphone, as it has always been difficult for me to translate unknown words and store them somewhere.

With this new application, I find it easy to get the translation of a word I don’t know, to save it in my personal vocabulary and then export it wherever I want.

## New website

This year I have redesigned my website a few times and have settled on the current layout. Now it’s more modern (as I think), fast (I spend a lot of time optimizing and getting into compression), and powered by WordPress.

Within the year I have also made and documented 6 versions of the current design.

## Updated Snippets, Tools, Blog, About pages

After I released the new design I coded Snippets, Tools and Blog pages from scratch. Now blog posts and snippets are intelligently grouped into categories providing a user with easy navigation.

About page now displays all the certificates I got, skills I’ve learned, my environment and so on.

Tools page shows all the tools I’ve built.

## What I learned this year

- Building Ethereum projects using web3.js and **Solidity**.
- Creating native Android applications using **Java**.
- Writing different programs using **Python**.
- Making any template work on top of the **WordPress**.
- Optimizing WordPress and its content.

## Miscellaneous

- Participated in **2** WorldSkills championships and took **II place**.
- Visited [New York City](//kottsov.com/posts/new-york-city/), Kazan.
- Worked for FIFA World Cup 2018.

## What I want to do next year

- Learn React/Vue/Ember/Angular, Webpack, Docker, GraphQL/Redux.
- Learn NoSQL databases (such as MongoDB) and how to work with them in terms of real projects.
- Learn PWAs.
- Consider moving my website to an SSG.
- Learn cryptography.
- Learn web typography.
