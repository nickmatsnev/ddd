## Videos

As for the serials, I have entirely watched Mr. Robot this year. I haven’t watched a lot of films and serials because I spent the vast majority of my free time on YouTube learning web development. I also want to mention some YouTube authors I discovered:

- [The Coding Train](//www.youtube.com/user/shiffman)
- [Marques Brownlee](//www.youtube.com/channel/UCBJycsmduvYEL83R_U4JriQ)
- [Matt D’Avella](//www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ24N4O0bP7LGLBDvye7oCA)
- [Jusuf](//www.youtube.com/channel/UCvrrZ9eseneke2UVe01ob2g)
- [Devon Crawford](//www.youtube.com/channel/UCDrekHmOnkptxq3gUU0IyfA)
- [Ali Abdaal](//www.youtube.com/channel/UCoOae5nYA7VqaXzerajD0lg)
- [DevTips](//www.youtube.com/channel/UCyIe-61Y8C4_o-zZCtO4ETQ)
- [Siraj Raval](//www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A)

## Websites

The following websites helped me learn web development:

- [Smashing Magazine](//www.smashingmagazine.com/)
- [CSS-Tricks](//css-tricks.com/)
- [A List Apart](//alistapart.com/)
- [bitsofcode](//bitsofco.de/)

## LinguaRead

This summer I have presented my school project called [LinguaRead](//kottsov.com/projects/linguaread/). I learned a lot about Android and Java to be able to create this application. I experienced a lot of problems reading electronic books on my smartphone because I found it difficult to translate and save unknown words.

With this new application, it is easy to get the translation of a word I don’t know. Now I can put it in my personal vocabulary and learn it in the future.

## New website

This year I have redesigned my website. Now it's modern, fast and powered by WordPress. Within the year I have also made and documented 6 versions of the current design.

## Updated Snippets, Tools, Blog, About pages

After I released the new design I created Snippets, Tools and Blog pages from scratch. Now blog posts and snippets are intelligently grouped into categories providing a user with easy navigation.

About page now displays all the certificates I got, skills I’ve learned, my environment and so on.

Tools page shows all the tools I’ve built.

## What I learned this year

- Building Ethereum projects using web3.js and **Solidity**.
- Creating native Android applications using **Java**.
- Writing different programs using **Python**.
- Creating templates for **WordPress**.
- Optimizing WordPress and its content.

## Miscellaneous

- Participated in **2** WorldSkills championships and took **II place** twice.
- Visited [New York City](//kottsov.com/posts/new-york-city/), Kazan.
- Worked for FIFA World Cup 2018.

## What I want to do next year

- Learn React/Vue/Ember/Angular, Webpack, Docker, GraphQL/Redux.
- Learn NoSQL databases (such as MongoDB) and how to work with them in terms of real projects.
- Learn PWAs.
- Consider moving my website to an SSG.
- Learn cryptography.
- Learn web typography.
