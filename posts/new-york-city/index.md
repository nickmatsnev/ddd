I’ve been to New York this summer, and in this post I want to share my notes and photos of this famous city. 

One of the most well-known NYC attractions is Times Square, so it's worth visiting this place just to see it on your own. There were a lot of people there, so I guess that the best time to come here is night or early morning.

Once you cross the Brooklyn Bridge you can see the Brooklyn Bridge Park that has a wonderful view of the Lower Manhattan. I advise you to come here in the evening during the sunset in order to get the most spectacular view.

There are several options to see the Statue of Liberty. If you don’t want to get very close to it, there is a free Staten Island ferry that passes 50 meters by the Statue of Liberty. I considered it to be enough to enjoy this city attraction.

I have heard several times that the subway in New York is too complicated and difficult to ride. It is no longer true, as there is a mobile app that helps you build routes. It will tell you what trains you should take, what the hours of operation are, how many changes you'll have to make during the ride.

The next place to discover was the World Trade Center, that is especially beautiful during the night.

New York is known for its skyscrapers. In addition to admiring their height and beauty from the ground, it is worth visiting observation decks that all famous skyscrapers have. I haven't been to any of them, because the language school I attended had this admiring view of the city.

In the US you can buy food and drinks in pharmacies, which is not common in other countries.

In my opinion, New York City has one of the best navigation systems. Streets and avenues that cross each other at right angles form a grid that is very easy to locate yourself in. Addresses usually contain the street number and the avenue number. For example, _W 34th St & 8th Ave_ means the intersection of West 34th Street and 8th Avenue.

US flags are everywhere.

There are more than 38K policemen in NYC, so you're likely to see them wherever you go.

You often hear siren sounds in Manhattan.

A lot of people use the free ferry to get from Staten Island to Manhattan.

New York is also famous for its yellow taxis, that are everywhere.
