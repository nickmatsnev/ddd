I’ve been to New York this summer, and by this post is to share all my notes and some of my photos of this famous city.

One of the most famous NYC attractions is Times Square, so it was worth visiting this place just to see it on your own. There were a lot of people there, so the best time to come here is night or early morning.

Once you cross the Brooklyn Bridge you should definitely visit Brooklyn Bridge Park, as there is a wonderful view of the City Skyline. You are likely to see the most spectacular view in the evening during the sunset.

There are several options to see the Statue of Liberty, and if you don’t want to come as close as possible, there is a free Staten Island ferry that passes 50 meters away from the Statue of Liberty, and it is enough to enjoy this city attraction.

There is still an opinion that NYC Subway is too complicated and difficult to ride. It is no longer true, as there is a mobile app that helps you to build routes and tells you what train to take and how many changes you’ll make.

The next place to discover is the World Trade Center, which is especially beautiful during nighttime. It is not far away from Wall Street.

New York is known for its skyscrapers, and apart from seeing them from the street, it is definitely worth visiting observatory decks. I’d recommend visiting the Empire State Building Observatory Deck as it gives you the most comprehensive view of the Manhattan.

In the US you can buy food and drinks in pharmacies, which is not common in other countries.

New York City has the perfect grid navigation system, which consists of avenues and streets, that intersect at right angles. So all addresses are like _34th & 8 Ave_, which means you have to go to the intersection of 34th Street and 8 Avenue, which is pretty simple.

While in New York and in the US in general, you will notice flags everywhere: on the streets, metro trains, buses, etc.

There are also a lot of police cars and policemen, so you feel secure wherever you go, especially at night.

It is amazing how people yield emergency vehicles.
