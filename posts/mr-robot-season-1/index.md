**Drinking the Kool-Aid** usually refers to people who blindly accept the “truths” of charismatic charlatans that have alternate agendas, which can lead their followers to physical, emotional, or financial harm and even death. It’s often assumed that people who drink the Kool-Aid are stupid or uneducated.

> — Look, I just needed a job.  
> — What kind of an excuse is that?
